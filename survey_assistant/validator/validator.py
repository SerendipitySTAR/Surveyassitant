    ## Methods and Materials
    We used a systematic literature search...

    ## Results
    Several themes emerged, including the use of CNNs and Transformers.
    Theme A: CNNs in X-Rays. Paper X shows good results.
    Theme B: Transformers for MRI. Paper Y demonstrates potential.

    ## Conclusion
    AI in medical imaging is rapidly evolving. Future work should focus on clinical validation.
